## [Course 1. Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/huyvohcmc/coursera-dsa/tree/master/algorithmic-toolbox)

#### Week 1. Introduction

Upon completing this programming assignment you will be able to:

1. Implement solutions that work much more faster than straightforward solutions for the following com-
   putational problems:
   (a) compute a small Fibonacci number;
   (b) compute the last digit of a large Fibonacci number;
   (c) compute a huge Fibonacci number modulo m;
   (d) compute the greatest common divisor of two integers;
   (e) compute the least common multiple of two integers.
2. See the huge difference between a slow algorithm and a fast one.
3. Implement algorithms covered in the lectures, design new algorithms.
4. Practice implementing, testing, and debugging your solution. In particular, you will find out how in
   practice, when you implement an algorithm, you bump into unexpected questions and problems not
   covered by the general description of the algorithm. You will also check your understanding of the
   algorithm itself and most probably see that there are some aspects you did not think of before you
   had to actually implement it. You will overcome all those complexities, implement the algorithms, test
   them, debug, and submit to the system. Remember the advice (link) we gave you in the first module
   about testing your programs and feel free to return to those videos or parts of them again while working
   on your assignment. In the end of this document you will find also general recommendations on solving
   algorithmic problems.

#### Week 2. Greedy Algorithms

Upon completing this programming assignment you will be able to:

1. Apply greedy strategy to solve various computational problems. This will usually require you to design
   an algorithm that repeatedly makes the most profitable move to construct a solution. You will then
   need to show that the moves of your algorithm are safe, meaning that they are consistent with at least
   one optimal solution.
2. Implement an efficient algorithm to optimally pack your bag before going to a hike.
3. Design and implement a greedy algorithm for a novel computational problem.
4. Design and implement a greedy algorithm for changing money optimally.

#### Week 3. Divide and Conquer

Upon completing this programming assignment you will be able to:

1. Apply the divide-and-conquer technique to solve various computational problems efficiently. This will
   usually require you to design an algorithm that solves a problem by splitting it into several disjoint
   subproblems, solving them recursively, and then combining their results to get an answer for the initial
   problem.
2. Implement the binary search algorithm that is used to search keys in sorted data.
3. Implement the quick sort algorithm which is one of the fastest and most commonly used in practice
   sorting algorithms.
4. Design and implement efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms for novel computational problems.

#### Week 4. Dynamic Programming

Upon completing this programming assignment you will be able to:

1. Apply the dynamic programming technique to solve various computational problems. This will usu-
   ally require you to design an algorithm that solves a problem by solving a collection of overlapping
   subproblems (as opposed to the divide-and-conquer technique where subproblems are usually disjoint)
   and combining the results.
2. Implement an efficient algorithm to optimally fill in a box with bars of gold.
3. Implement an efficient algorithm to compute the difference between two files or strings. Such algorithms
   are widely used in spell checking programs and version control systems.
4. Implement a more advanced algorithm for computing the maximum value of an arithmetic expression.
5. Design and implement a dynamic programming algorithm for a novel computational problem.
6. See two examples of an optimization problem where a natural greedy strategy produces a non-optimal
   result. You will see that a natural greedy move for these problems is not safe.
